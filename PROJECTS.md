# Project Descriptions

## E-Commerce Supply Chain Analysis
Developed a delivery performance dashboard to uncover inefficiencies in e-commerce supply chains. Using SQL and Tableau, the project visualizes processing times, late delivery rates, return rates, order status distribution, and monthly order volumes. Data preparation was performed in Python to ensure clean, reliable inputs for decision makers.

## AirCab eVTOL Project Management
Led an end-to-end aerospace systems engineering effort to design an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. The documentation spans concept development through certification, covering propulsion, aerodynamics, cabin systems, avionics, and risk management. Deliverables feature a 100-unit production plan for Uber, a detailed work breakdown structure, multi-year schedule, and a cost estimate exceeding $67M.

## Customer Segment Analysis (Power BI)
Built an interactive Power BI report that segments customers using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics. The solution explores purchasing patterns and demographic trends, empowering stakeholders to identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies. It leverages DAX, Power Query, and star-schema data modeling for scalable insights.

## Product Management for PAL
Outlined the product strategy for PAL, a personal assistant aimed at modern homes. The plan emphasizes accessibility, personalization, energy efficiency, and mental wellbeing while defining a vision of "Effortless Living, Enriched Minds." Features include facial recognition, voice control, and smart device integration, supported by 5C marketing analysis, operational models, market assessment, go-to-market tactics, risk management, and post-launch support.

## Wine Origin Exploratory Analysis
Performed exploratory data analysis on a classical wine dataset to identify chemical attributes that predict wine cultivar origins. Statistical methods and visualizations—such as histograms and scatter plots—revealed alcohol concentration as the strongest indicator, with color intensity moderately predictive and magnesium levels offering limited insight.

## NVIDIA Financial Analysis & Forecasting
Created a comprehensive financial model for NVIDIA, covering profitability, liquidity, leverage, and efficiency ratios from 2014 to 2023. A time-series forecasting module projects future performance while summarizing industry context and business risks. Advanced Excel features, including VBA macros, pivot tables, and dashboards, automate calculations and support interactive analysis.

## Best City to Live (Excel Dashboard)
Designed an Excel dashboard that helps users evaluate and compare U.S. cities based on livability factors. Users can weight criteria such as cost of living, safety, healthcare, and climate, with interactive filters and dynamic charts delivering real-time scoring updates. VBA macros and pivot tables power the underlying logic.

## Predictive Analytics with R
Forecasted hourly bike rental demand using R by examining environmental and temporal drivers. Feature engineering and model comparisons—spanning linear regression, regression trees, and random forests—demonstrated that the random forest model achieved an adjusted R² of 85.88%, with hour, temperature, and weekday emerging as the most influential predictors.
